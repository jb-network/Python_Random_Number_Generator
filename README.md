# Python_Random_Number_Generator

# Course Total Python: Become an Advance Python Developer
# Day 4 Challenge

The challenge has the follow guidelines:

1) Ask user's name
2) Create random number between 1 and 100
3) User guesses (either they guess correct or lose after 8 rounds
4) Must have:
  A) Must tell if the guess is out of bounds
  B) Must tell if the guess is too low or too high
5) Must provide win and lose notification

I added a cheat for fun that will allow any player named "Kallie" to automatically win.
